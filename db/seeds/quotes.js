  "O snail \r\nClimb Mt. Fuji \r\nBut slowly, slowly!",
  "I stand above the world, which has now become for me, in a quite peculiar sense, phenomenon.",
  "We're the Tattooed Lady, and we're never going to have a minute's peace, the rest of our lives, till everybody else is tattooed, too.",
  "Beware when the so-called sagely men come limping into sight... I could happily lie down and die sometimes.",
  "Oh, I've had my moments, and if I had to do it over again, I'd have more of them... \r\nI've been one of those people who never goes anywhere without a thermometer, a hot water bottle, a raincoat, and a parachute. \r\nIf I had to do it again, I would travel lighter than I have",
  "The mind is its own place, and in itself \r\nCan make a Heaven of Hell, and Hell of Heaven",
  "I have become nothing but speech and the tumbling of a brook from high rocks. I want to hurl my words down into the valleys.",
  "I go new ways; like all creators I have grown weary of old tongues. My spirit no longer wants to walk in worn-out soles.",
  "The spectacle's social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial production. The \"growth\" generated by an economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the very alienation that was its origin.",
  "The reigning economic system is a vicious circle of isolation. Its technologies are based on isolation, and they contribute to that same isolation. From automobiles to televisions, the goods that the spectacular system chooses to produce also serve it as weapons for constantly reinforcing the conditions that engender \"lonely crowds.\" With ever-increasing concreteness the spectacle recreates its own presuppositions.",
  "The root of the spectacle is that oldest of all social specializations, the specialization of power. The spectacle plays the specialized role of speaking in the name of all other activities. It is hierarchical society's ambassador to itself, delivering its messages at a court where no one else is allowed to speak. The most modern aspect of the spectacle is thus also the most archaic.",
  "The society based on modern industry is not accidentally or superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally spectaclist. In the spectacle - the visual reflection of the ruling economic order - goals are nothing, development is everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other than itself.",
  "But for the present age, which preferred the sign to the thing signified, the copy to the original, representation to reality, appearance to essence ... truth is considered profane, and only illusion is sacred. Sacredness is in fact held to be enhanced in proportion as truth decreases and illusion increases, so that the highest degree of illusion comes to be seen as the highest degree of sacredness.",
  "It was now clear to Shevek, and he would have thought it folly to think otherwise, that his wretched years in the city had all been part of his present great happiness, because they had lead up to it, prepared him for it. Everything that had happened to him was part of what was happening to him now.",
  "They all looked, to him, anxious. He had often seen that anxiety before in the faces of Urrasti, and wondered about it. Was it because, no matter how much money they had, they always had to worry about making more, lest they die poor? Was it guilt, because no matter how little money they had, there was always somebody who had less?",
  "The wonderful thing about hope is that it has absolutely no effect on anything.",
  "Paolo knew the Contingency Handler could feel no compassion for their plight; it could only utter the formalities programmed into it so long ago, translated as best as it could. But the message it conveyed still managed to bridge time, and scale, and cultures. It said, \"Bring your people through. They're welcome here. There's room enough for everyone.\"",
  "Sustained life is a property of an ecological system rather than a single organism or species. Traditional biology has tended to concentrate attention on individual organisms rather than in the biological continuum. The origin of life is thus looked for as a unique event in which an organism arises from the surrounding milieu. A more ecologically balanced point of view would examine the proto-ecological cycles and subsequent chemical systems that must have developed and flourished while objects resembling organisms appeared.",
  "When a cell reproduces, it passes on not only its genes, but also its membranes, enzymes, organelles - in short, the whole cellular network. The new cell is not produced from naked DNA, but from an unbroken continuation of the entire autopoietic network. Naked DNA is never passed on, because genes can only function when they are embedded in the epigenetic network. Thus life has unfolded over three billion years in an uninterrupted process, without ever breaking the basic patter of its self-generating networks.",
  "This notion sheds new light on the age-old philosophical debate about freedom and determinism. According to Maturana, the behavior of a living organism is determined, but rather than being determined by outside forces, it is determined by the organism's own structure - a structure formed by a succession of autonomous structural changes. Hence the behavior of the living organism is both determined and free.",
  "Think of that which is not evil \r\nTrain in the way \r\nTake an interest in all the arts \r\nKnow the way of all professions \r\nKnow how to appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of each thing \r\nLearn to judge the quality of each thing \r\nPerceive and understand that which is not visible from the outside \r\nBe attentive even to minimal things \r\nDo not perform useless acts",
  "I vow to practice mindful breathing and smiling, looking deeply into things. I vow to understand living beings and their suffering, to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, and to practice joy and equanimity.",
  "Search your heart \r\nand see \r\nthe way to do \r\nis to be",
  "How would it be \r\nif just for today \r\nwe thought less about contests and trivialities, \r\nprofits and politics, \r\nwinners and sinners, \r\nand more about helping and giving, \r\nmending and blending, \r\nreaching out \r\nand pitching in?  \r\n \r\nHow would it be?",
  "Social systems use communications as their particular mode of autopoietic reproduction. Their elements are communications that are recursively produced and reproduced by a network of communications and that cannot exist outside of such a network.",
  "The observation of genetic redundancy is in stark contradiction to genetic determinism, and in particular to the metaphor of the \"selfish gene\" proposed by biologist Richard Dawkins. According to Dawkins, genes behave as if they were selfish by constantly competing, via the organisms they produce, to leave more copies of themselves. From this reductionist perspective the widespread existence of redundant genes makes no evolutionary sense. From the systemic point of view, by contrast, we recognize that natural selection operates not on individual genes but on the organisms' patterns of self-organization. As Keller puts it, \"It is the endurance of the life cycle itself that has ... become the subject of evolution.\"",
  "Unlike chromosomes, genes are not physical objects but merely concepts that have acquired a great deal of historic baggage over the past decades ... We may have well come to the point where the use of the term \"gene\" is of limited value and might in fact be a hindrance to our understanding of the genome.",
  "Humberto Maturana was one of the first scientists to link the biology of human consciousness to language in a systemic way. He did so by approaching language through a careful analysis of communication within the framework of the Santiago Theory of Cognition. Communication, according to Maturana, is not the transmission of information but rather the coordination of behaviour between living organisms through mutual structural coupling. In these recurrent interactions, the living organisms change together through their mutual triggering of structural changes. Such mutual coordination is the key characteristic of communication for all living organisms, with or without nervous systems, and it becomes more subtle and elaborate with nervous systems of increasing complexity.",
  "Since gravity brings about the increasing density of matter in stellar regions, and nuclear and electromagnetic forces combined with the exclusion principle build up integrated nonhomogenous atomic structures, the very nature of reality conspires to build systems rather than distribute matter evenly, or condense it into featureles blobs.",
  "Form is emptiness, and emptiness is indeed form. Emptiness is not different than form, form is not different than emptiness. What is form that is epmtiness, what is emptiness that is form.",
  "The fact is that our whole concept of control is naive, primitive, and ridden with an almost retributive idea of causality. Control to most people (and what a reflection this is upon a sophisticated society!) is a crude process of coercion.",
